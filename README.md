# Green-Techno-Campus
This project was won us the third place in ACMW NATIONAL LEVEL HACKATHON 2022
Developed an IOT system integrated with smart sensors like KINECT SENSOR, temperature sensor and photo resistive sensor along with smart meters to automate turning on and off on home appliances within the vicinity of the human being and also detect carbon footprints emitted by the appliances.

Designed a WEB PORTAL to track and upload the carbon footprint data into the web portal as a real time database to detect and minimize areas of maximum energy consumption.

This project has a great scope for futuristic purposes in reducing the carbon footprint and creating an impact on the society.
